Your AI-Powered Insurance Intelligence System

💡 Problem Statement
Understanding health insurance is overwhelming.
Users don’t know:

What’s covered?

When are they eligible?

Why was a claim rejected?

Even worse, policies are long, unstructured PDFs with vague language. Users are forced to call support or give up altogether.

🎯 Goal
Build a system that understands natural human questions and instantly answers:

“Can I claim for this surgery?”

“How much will I get?”

“Why was my last claim denied?”

It reads the user’s actual policy and replies with clear, justified decisions, like:

“Yes, your surgery is covered. Clause 3.2 of Golden Shield covers it after 60 days. You’ve crossed 90 days.”
